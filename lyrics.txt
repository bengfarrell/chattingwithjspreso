May I have your attention please?
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To blow a raspberry (to blow a raspberry)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my foot (come take my foot)
We'll walk through my space rocket together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm

<voice="en-gb">
His arm pits are rough, hands greasy, feet are gentle
There's food on his skirt already, friend's pizza
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to blow a raspberry,
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down,

<voice="en">
And I am, a toad
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, a toad
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

<voice="en-gb">
You better chase the shadows away
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow a raspberry
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better chase the shadows away

<voice="en">
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow a raspberry
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo

<voice="en-gb">
So lets go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through my space rocket
I once used to call home sweet home

Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the park now

And when I'm gone, just blow a raspberry, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my rough arm pits
Just know that I'm looking down on you joking
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just chase the shadows away

And when he's gone, just blow a raspberry, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of his greasy hands
Just know that he's looking down on you laughing
And his didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just chase the shadows away in your skirt.
